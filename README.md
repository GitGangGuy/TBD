## Introduction

TBD is a [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) app for GitHub (though it is adaptable to other platforms), providing deep integration with trunk-based development workflows for your GitHub projects. It enforces [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) messages, a common [ISSUE->PR workflow](wiki/Workflow.md) and traceability from a commit back to its original issue. It aims to replace most other workflow-related GitHub apps with one unified solution.
